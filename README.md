Included in this Work sample are two projects that I programmed or assisted in programming.

These two example works include:

1-way communication device

	This is an embedded system programmed in C++ using a NUCLEO l4r5zi microprocessor. This project was built by me from the ground up. More information is in the included readme file.

data transmission protocols

	For this project, I created both the Selective Repeat and the Alternating Bit Protocols for use with network data transfer. The network layer for this project was simulated. The code in abt.c and sr.c are entirely mine. The overarching structure of this was not my creation, so it was not included.
