About
-------------------
Project Description:
    This system is a one-way communication device that allows one user to send remote tactile messages to another.
    The system does not require vision or hearing for either party to use it effectively.

Features
--------------------
    - Six-bump braille keyboard with tactile user feedback
    - Alphanumeric message entry up to 140 characters long
    - Morse code output via vibration motor and LED
    - Functionality for concurrent user input and output
    - System protection via watchdog
    - Mutex-based critical section protection

Required Materials
--------------------
    - Nucleo L4R5ZI
    - 9x push buttons
    - 2x vibration motors
    - 1x LED
    - 1x 1kâ„¦ resistor

--------------------
Getting Started
--------------------
    - Connect one end of all nine push buttons to PD 0 (vcc)
        For the other end of each push button:
        - Top-left bump button: connect to PC 6
        - Middle-left bump button: connect to PC 8
        - Bottom-left bump button: connect to PC 9
        - Top-right bump button: connect to PC 10
        - Middle-right bump button: connect to PC 11
        - Bottom-right bump button: connect to PC 12
        - Enter button: connect to PB 15
        - Backspace button: connect to PB 13
        - Send button: connect to PB 12
    - Connect the resistor and LED in series; connect the positive end to PB 1 and the negative end to ground.
    - Connect one end of both vibration motors to ground.
    - Connect the other end of the morse vibration motor to PF 8.
    - Connect the other end of the braille keyboard vibration motor to PE 14.

Declarations
----------

Mutexes:
    msglock: protects the msg and len global variables
    inputlock: protects the input global variable
    enterlock: used by enterThread and enterISR to protect against bounce
    backspacelock: used by backspaceThread and backspaceISR to protect against bounce
    sendlock: used by sendThread and sendISR to protect against bounce

Condition Variables:
    enterCond: enterThread will wait on this, and enterISR will signal
    backspaceCond: backspaceThread will wait on this, and backspaceISR will signal
    sendCond: sendThread will wait on this, and sendISR will signal

Interrupts:
    enterButton: calls enterISR
    backspaceButton: calls backspaceISR
    sendButton: calls sendISR

Bus:
    bumps: holds the 6 bump button inputs

Outputs:
    braillevibrate: vibration motor attached to braille keyboard to give user tactile feedback
    morsevibrate: vibration motor that is used to output the message in morse code
    + bitwise output used for the morse LED

Threads:
    isrThread: handles the event queue that the ISRs go through
    enterThread: handles functionality of enter button
    backspaceThread: handles functionality of backspace button
    sendThread: handles functionality of send button

EventQueue:
    queue: used by ISRs

ISR functions:
    enterISR: called when enterButton is pressed, signals enterThread
    backspaceISR: called when backspaceButton is pressed, signals backspaceThread
    sendISR: called when sendButton is pressed, signals sendThread

Thread functions:
    enter: used by enterThread
    backspace: used by backspaceThread
    send: used by sendThread

Global Variables:
    msg: character array of size 140; stores the user's inputted message
    len: stores the length of the message
    input: stores the bump button bus state as a 6-bit number, each bit corresponding to one button

Custom Functions
----------
    brailleToText: takes a 6-bit number (i.e. 0x111000) and interprets that as a braille character,
    each bit corresponding to one of the bumps. Returns the character that set of bumps is associated with.

    printMorse: reads the message and outputs the morse code representation.

    dot: used by printMorse; outputs a morse "dot" signal.

    dash: used by printMorse; outputs a morse "dash" signal.
